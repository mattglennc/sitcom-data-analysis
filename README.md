# Sitcom Data Analysis

This project explores trends in iconic sitcoms from the mid-2000s to early 2010s by analyzing episode-level data such as IMDb ratings, air dates, viewership, and season structures. Using Python and pandas for data wrangling and seaborn/matplotlib for visualization, we investigate which shows were the most consistent, when they peaked, and how external factors like time gaps or air days may relate to success.
